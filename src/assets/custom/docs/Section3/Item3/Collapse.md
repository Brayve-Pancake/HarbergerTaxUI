#### Investment Efficiency

In a Partial Common Ownership system, asset owners pay higher taxes in the long run compared to a Private Ownership system. This increased tax burden reduces the potential returns on investment, leading to slightly lower financial incentives for investing in their property. This is known as a decrease in investment efficiency.

Partial Common Ownership reduces investment efficiency by a relatively small amount for a much larger increase in allocative efficiency.
