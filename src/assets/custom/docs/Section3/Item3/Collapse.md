#### Investment Efficiency

Because the amount of tax you pay is based on the self-assessed valuation of the property, if the money you invest into a vacant plot of land increases the output of that land and hence your valuation increases. 10% of the increase in value is captured by the tax and the remainder is captured by you. * Link to investment efficiency example?

Partial Common Ownership reduces investment efficiency, by a relatively small amount for a much larger increase in allocatable efficiency.
