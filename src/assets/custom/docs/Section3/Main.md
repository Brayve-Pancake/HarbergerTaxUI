First, society OWNS all of the land, and as a citizen you can purchase the rights to use the land (build, produce, fish, harvest), and  ability to exclude others from using it. You are now the Possessor of the land! Yay!

So who do I pay?
You pay the current possessor their self-assessed price.
You also pay X% to society each year*.

When do I pay?
All plots of land are always for sale, the current possessor set's their own price.
