### How Does Private Ownership Work?
Governments sell plots of land to raise money and encourage economic growth, which in turn improves the living standards of society as a whole.

If you buy a plot of land, you get three main benefits:
a. The right to use the land
b. The right to exclude others from using it
c. The right to sell it whenever you want

### Okay, so what's the problem?

Part c is important here. If you decide to buy land but leave it unused, it prevents others from building useful things like businesses, parks, or museums  that could benefit society.

In this example, your plot of land is unproductive. The land could produce more benefit for society if it was owned by someone else.
