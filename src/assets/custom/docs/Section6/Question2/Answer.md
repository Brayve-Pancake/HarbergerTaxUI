Partial Common Ownership is a model for ownership where assets are always for sale. To ensure that a fair price is set, owners of assets must pay a continual "Harberger" tax on their assessed price, which discourages them from setting an impossibly high price.
So, PCO is a model and Harberger Taxation is a mechanism that facilitates the idea.
