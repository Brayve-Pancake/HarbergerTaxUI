#### How does Private Ownership Work?

1. A government sells property rights to plots of land to raise capital.
2. The new owner of the land has three main things:
    * the right to use the land
    * the right to exclude others from using it
    * The right to sell it when you want
3. The owner of the land determines when the land can be sold on and the price.
4. If an owner sells, they are incentivize to set a high price for profit.
