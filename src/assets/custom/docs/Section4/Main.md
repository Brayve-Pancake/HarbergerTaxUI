In the game, there was a tax that owners paid continually at a rate of 10% per year based on their valuation of their property. This mechanism is called Harberger Taxation.

Harberger Taxation:
1. Owners must pay an X% tax based on their self-assessed value.
2. Owners must sell at their self-assessed value.

If you must sell at your self-assessed value and the Turnover rate of assets is high, then you could set a higher price.
It's important you see these two act in opposite directions...
