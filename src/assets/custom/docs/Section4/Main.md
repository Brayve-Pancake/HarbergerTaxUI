## Partial Common Ownership

1. A government sells property rights to plots of land to raise capital.

2. The new owner of the land has two main things:
    * the right to use the land
    * the ability to exclude others from using it

3. The owner of the land determines the for-sale price.
4. Because of the harberger tax, the owner is incentivised to set a lower price.
