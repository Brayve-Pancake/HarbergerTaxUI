Humans use the domain name system (DNS) to navigate the internet, for example, these are some common domain names: Facebook.com, GreenPeace.org, Evian.com

The Ethereum Name System is a lot like the DNS and it faces an investor hoarding problem. When the names first became available, many early investors bought up all of the short names at a very low cost, then put them on to a secondary market at a very high price in the name of profit.

If Harberger Taxes were used, then those investors would have to pay taxes on their high self-assessed value, this incentivises them to lower their SAV. Hence, people who want to use that name may now be able to afford it.
