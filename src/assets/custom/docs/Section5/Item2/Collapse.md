Advertisement space on the web could use a Harberger taxation system.

Advertisers could purchase the rights to advertise over a specific amount of digital space. They would be required to set a self-assess value (SAV) for the space and pay taxes on that SAV. This cost prevents them from hoarding advertising space and encourages them to reduce the price of their advertising space which prevents them from hoarding assets and blocking other smaller businesses from using the space.
