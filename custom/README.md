## Instructions
1. Copy the assets inside the folder from ./src/assets/custom into this directory

2. Make any changes you want to this copied custom folder to see them reflected on the website

## Notes

Most things should be pretty self explanatory I think... I'm kinda brain dead at this point lol

The design is built off of Bootstrap 4 so certain variables are easy to override. In particular `primary`, `secondary`, `light`, `info`, etc. These are the main things that dictate button colors and the other colors are generated based on that 

I didn't get to do much editing on the original design at all. I'll work on that later though
